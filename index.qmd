## Biography

I am a **computational biologist** and **biomedical data science trainer** at the [University of Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk), with a focus on functional genomics, transcriptomics, and single-cell sequencing technologies.

I actively develop solutions for interactive data visualisation and research software engineering to advance biological discovery. I am an active contributor to the Bioconductor project, developing and maintaining R packages for the community. My academic research explores the host immune response to infectious diseases, inflammation, and self-antigens.
