## Biography

I am a **computational biologist** and **biomedical data science trainer** at the [University of Oxford](https://ox.ac.uk), with a focus on functional genomics and single-cell sequencing.

I actively collaborate on a range of research projects, predominantly applying single-cell analysis to diverse biological questions.

Inspiration from these collaborations drives my development of research software, with a particular emphasis on interactive data visualisation.

I am also an active contributor to the [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) project, where I develop and maintain R packages together with the community.
